### mapping of sensible areas
* raptor nests: ample system:
* red = breeding: no-go area 50m
* orange = breeding status unclear = be very silent & cautious
* green = no breeding assumption = normal field work possible

### mapping of traps and camera traps
* raccoon traps (cage traps): please do not touch anything
* traps are usually only supplied with bait (not activated for catchiung)
* only very few hours active (in the night) and we will be present somewhere in the forest with veterinary etc.
* please pass behind the (camouflaged) cameras to not trigger them

### mapping of hunting zones

* red = please do not disturb that zone
